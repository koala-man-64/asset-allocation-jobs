# DATA

This document is the current data interface contract for AssetAllocation. It covers the canonical persisted datasets written by the Bronze, Silver, and Gold jobs under `tasks/` for the `market`, `finance`, `earnings`, and `price-target` domains, plus the Postgres-backed strategy and ranking control-plane contracts used by the strategies and rankings APIs and UI.

Scope notes:

- This contract primarily documents the bucketed medallion tables, with control-plane exceptions for `core.strategies`, `core.ranking_schemas`, `core.ranking_runs`, and `core.ranking_watermarks`.
- `finance` Bronze stores provider payloads as opaque JSON strings. Downstream contracts are the extracted Silver and Gold schemas, not the provider's full inner JSON shape.
- The Postgres `gold.*` tables are serving replicas of the canonical Gold Delta buckets. `core.gold_sync_state` tracks whether each alphabet bucket has been fully synchronized for a given source commit.

## Contract Conventions

| Convention | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `symbol` | Uppercased ticker/symbol identifier used across all domains. |
| `date` / `obs_date` | Timezone-naive normalized date/datetime field written by the ETL job. |
| `number` | Nullable numeric metric. Writer code typically uses `float64` unless explicitly noted otherwise. |
| `binary flag` | `0` or `1` indicator derived from business logic or pattern detection. |
| `nullable int` | Integer metric persisted with null support. |
| `json string` | Compact serialized provider payload stored as a string; inner keys are provider-defined and not frozen by this repo. |
| `bucket` layout | Canonical persisted datasets are written to alphabet bucket paths such as `.../buckets/A`, `.../buckets/B`, and so on. |

## Ranking Control Plane

### Ranking Schema Storage

Path: `Postgres table core.ranking_schemas`

Each row stores one named ranking schema plus a versioned `config` payload. Revisions are appended to `core.ranking_schema_revisions`, materialization runs are recorded in `core.ranking_runs`, and per-strategy freshness is tracked in `core.ranking_watermarks`.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Unique ranking schema identifier referenced by strategy config. |
| `description` | string | Optional human-readable description shown in the ranking workbench. |
| `version` | integer | Monotonic version incremented on each save. |
| `config` | JSON object | Validated `RankingSchemaConfig` describing groups, weighted factors, and ordered transforms. |
| `updated_at` | datetime | Server-managed timestamp set to `NOW()` on insert and update. |

### Ranking Schema Config: `config`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `universeConfigName` | string | Required name of the saved universe configuration applied to the ranking schema itself. Ranking previews and materialization intersect this universe with the selected strategy universe. |
| `groups` | array of `RankingGroup` | Required array of weighted groups. |
| `overallTransforms` | array of `RankingTransform` | Ordered transforms applied after weighted group aggregation. |

### Ranking Group

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Unique group name within the schema. |
| `weight` | number | Relative contribution of the group to the final score. |
| `factors` | array of `RankingFactor` | Required array of weighted factor definitions. |
| `transforms` | array of `RankingTransform` | Ordered transforms applied to the group score after factor aggregation. |

### Ranking Factor

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Unique factor name within the containing group. |
| `table` | string | Gold serving table name, for example `market_data` or `finance_data`. |
| `column` | string | Numeric or boolean scalar column in the selected gold table. |
| `weight` | number | Relative contribution of the factor within the group. |
| `direction` | enum | `desc` means higher values are better; `asc` means lower values are better. |
| `missingValuePolicy` | enum | `exclude` drops rows with missing factor values; `zero` fills missing values with `0`. |
| `transforms` | array of `RankingTransform` | Ordered transform chain applied to the raw factor values before weighted group aggregation. |

### Ranking Transform

Supported transform types:

- `percentile_rank`
- `zscore`
- `minmax`
- `clip`
- `winsorize`
- `coalesce`
- `log1p`
- `negate`
- `abs`

Parameter rules:

- `clip` accepts `lower` and/or `upper`
- `winsorize` accepts `lowerQuantile` and/or `upperQuantile`
- `coalesce` requires `value`
- the remaining transform types reject params

### Strategy-to-Ranking Link

`StrategyConfig` now supports `rankingSchemaName`, which links a saved strategy to a named ranking schema. `core.strategies.output_table_name` stores the sanitized platinum table identifier used during materialization.

### Ranking Materialization Output

Path: `Postgres table platinum.<strategy_output_table>`

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `date` | date | Ranking as-of date. |
| `symbol` | string | Uppercased ticker/symbol identifier. |
| `rank` | integer | Cross-sectional rank for the strategy/date where `1` is best. |
| `score` | number | Weighted composite score used to order symbols before rank assignment. |
| `last_updated_date` | date | Date the row was last materialized into platinum. |

## Strategies

### Strategy Storage

Path: `Postgres table core.strategies`

Each row stores a single named strategy. The API returns either the full record (`/strategies/{name}/detail`) or just the validated `config` payload (`/strategies/{name}`). On create or update, the API validates and normalizes the incoming `config` against `StrategyConfig` before writing it back to Postgres.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Unique strategy identifier. This is the lookup key used by the repository and API routes. |
| `type` | string | Freeform strategy classification string. The API defaults it to `configured`; the current UI offers `configured` and `code-based`. |
| `description` | string | Optional human-readable description shown in the UI and returned by the detail API. |
| `updated_at` | datetime | Server-managed timestamp set to `NOW()` on insert and update. |
| `config` | JSON object | Nested `StrategyConfig` document containing selection settings, conflict policy, and exit-rule definitions. |

### Strategy Config: `config`

Unexpected keys are rejected. The backend model uses `extra="forbid"` for both `StrategyConfig` and `ExitRule`, so the contract below is closed rather than open-ended.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `universeConfigName` | string | Required name of the saved universe configuration attached to the strategy. Strategy materialization resolves this config independently from the ranking schema universe. |
| `rebalance` | string | Rebalance cadence label. Default is `monthly`; the current UI offers `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, and `quarterly`. |
| `longOnly` | boolean | Long-only flag for the strategy. Default is `true`. |
| `topN` | integer | Target number of selected holdings or symbols. Must be `>= 1`. Default is `20`. |
| `lookbackWindow` | integer | Lookback window used by strategy logic. Must be `>= 1`. Default is `63`. |
| `holdingPeriod` | integer | Planned holding horizon in bars or days. Must be `>= 1`. Default is `21`. |
| `costModel` | string | Cost-model identifier used by strategy or simulation logic. Default is `default`. |
| `intrabarConflictPolicy` | enum | Same-bar tie-break policy when multiple exit rules trigger. Supported values are `stop_first`, `take_profit_first`, and `priority_order`. Default is `stop_first`. |
| `exits` | array of `ExitRule` | Ordered list of exit rules. Duplicate rule IDs are rejected. When `priority` is omitted, the backend normalizes it to the rule's array index. |

### Universe Config Storage

Path: `Postgres table core.universe_configs`

Universe configurations are first-class saved objects reused by both strategies and ranking schemas. Revisions are appended to `core.universe_config_revisions`.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Unique universe configuration identifier. |
| `description` | string | Optional UI-facing description. |
| `version` | integer | Monotonic version incremented on each save. |
| `config` | JSON object (`UniverseDefinition`) | Structured rule tree filtered against Postgres `gold.*` serving tables. |
| `updated_at` | datetime | Server-managed timestamp set to `NOW()` on insert and update. |

### Universe Definition: `core.universe_configs.config`

Universe authoring is limited to the Postgres `gold.*` serving tables. The editor builds a recursive rule tree, and the preview endpoint resolves the current matching symbol set using the latest available row per symbol from each referenced gold table.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | enum | The only supported value is `postgres_gold`. |
| `root` | object (`UniverseGroup`) | Root boolean group for the universe rule tree. Must contain at least one clause. |

### Universe Groups And Conditions

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | enum | Discriminator. Groups use `group`; conditions use `condition`. |
| `operator` | enum | Group operator. Supported values are `and` and `or`. |
| `clauses` | array | Child groups or conditions. Empty groups are rejected by the backend. |
| `table` | string | Gold table name, for example `market_data` or `finance_data`. Only `gold.*` tables exposed by the catalog endpoint are allowed. |
| `column` | string | Scalar column name within the selected gold table. Non-scalar columns are excluded from the catalog and rejected by preview validation. |
| `operator` | enum | Condition operator. Supported values are `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `in`, `not_in`, `is_null`, and `is_not_null`. |
| `value` | string, number, boolean, or null | Single-value input used by scalar operators such as `eq` or `gt`. Null operators reject both `value` and `values`. |
| `values` | array of string, number, or boolean | Multi-value input used only by `in` and `not_in`. |

### Universe Preview

- `GET /api/strategies/universe/catalog` returns eligible `gold.*` tables, their scalar columns, value kinds, and allowed operators.
- `POST /api/strategies/universe/preview` accepts a draft `UniverseDefinition` and returns `symbolCount`, `sampleSymbols`, `tablesUsed`, and `warnings`.
- Preview is current-state only for this milestone. It evaluates each condition against the latest available row per symbol in the referenced gold table and then combines clause results with `and` intersection or `or` union.

### Exit Rule Components: `config.exits[]`

Milestone 1 keeps exit handling constrained to full position exits. The UI reflects that by treating `scope` and `action` as fixed values.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Required rule identifier, unique within the strategy. This ID is emitted in exit decisions and trade metadata. |
| `enabled` | boolean | When `false`, the evaluator skips the rule entirely. Default is `true`. |
| `type` | enum | Rule type. Supported values are `stop_loss_fixed`, `take_profit_fixed`, `trailing_stop_pct`, `trailing_stop_atr`, and `time_stop`. |
| `scope` | enum | Exit scope. The only supported value is `position`. Default is `position`. |
| `priceField` | enum or null | Price observed on the bar to check whether the rule triggered. Supported values are `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close`. Type-specific defaults apply when omitted. |
| `value` | number or null | Rule threshold. For fixed and trailing-percent exits it is a percentage-like decimal, for ATR trailing stops it is an ATR multiple, and for `time_stop` it is a bar count. Must be `> 0`; `time_stop` requires an integer value. |
| `atrColumn` | string or null | Feature column name used only by `trailing_stop_atr`. Required for that rule type and rejected for all others. |
| `priority` | integer or null | Explicit rule order for resolution. Lower numbers win. If omitted, the backend assigns the array index. |
| `action` | enum | Exit action. The only supported value is `exit_full`. Default is `exit_full`. |
| `minHoldBars` | integer | Minimum `bars_held` before the rule is eligible to fire. Must be `>= 0`. Default is `0`. |
| `reference` | enum or null | Trigger anchor for price-based rules. Supported values are `entry_price` and `highest_since_entry`. Type-specific defaults apply; `time_stop` rejects `reference`. |

### Exit Rule Types And Trigger Semantics

| Rule type | Trigger calculation | Required fields | Defaults and constraints | Exit price recorded |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stop_loss_fixed` | `entry_price * (1 - value)` | `id`, `type`, `value` | Defaults `reference` to `entry_price` and `priceField` to `low`. Rejects `atrColumn`. | Computed trigger price, not the observed bar price. |
| `take_profit_fixed` | `entry_price * (1 + value)` | `id`, `type`, `value` | Defaults `reference` to `entry_price` and `priceField` to `high`. Rejects `atrColumn`. | Computed trigger price. |
| `trailing_stop_pct` | `(highest_since_entry or entry_price) * (1 - value)` | `id`, `type`, `value` | Defaults `reference` to `highest_since_entry` and `priceField` to `low`. Rejects `atrColumn`. | Computed trigger price. |
| `trailing_stop_atr` | `(highest_since_entry or entry_price) - (value * bar.features[atrColumn])` | `id`, `type`, `value`, `atrColumn` | Defaults `reference` to `highest_since_entry` and `priceField` to `low`. If the ATR feature is missing on the bar, the rule does not fire. | Computed trigger price. |
| `time_stop` | Fires once `bars_held >= value` | `id`, `type`, integer `value` | Forces `priceField` to `close`. Rejects `reference` and `atrColumn`. | Current bar `close` price. |

### Intrabar Conflict Policies

The evaluator sorts triggered candidates by `(priority, ordinal)` before applying policy-specific logic. `ordinal` is the rule's array position, so array order is the final tie-breaker when priorities match.

| Policy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `stop_first` | If a stop-like rule and a take-profit rule trigger on the same bar, choose the first stop-like candidate after ordering. If all triggered rules are from the same class, choose the first ordered rule. |
| `take_profit_first` | If both classes trigger on the same bar, choose the first take-profit candidate after ordering. Otherwise choose the first ordered rule. |
| `priority_order` | Ignore stop-versus-profit class and choose the first ordered rule directly. |

### Runtime Evaluation Notes

- The evaluator advances position state before testing exit rules. That means `bars_held` is incremented for the current bar first, and trailing-stop anchors such as `highest_since_entry` include the current bar's prices before trigger evaluation.
- A price-threshold rule checks the selected `priceField` against the trigger, but the emitted `exit_price` is the computed trigger price rather than the observed intrabar print.
- Disabled rules and rules blocked by `minHoldBars` are skipped.
- When more than one rule triggers on a bar, the evaluation records an intrabar conflict and returns a single chosen exit decision according to `intrabarConflictPolicy`.

### Editor-Seeded Defaults

These are UI defaults for newly created strategies and rules, not additional backend requirements:

- New run configurations start with no attached universe config, `rebalance=monthly`, `longOnly=true`, `topN=20`, `lookbackWindow=63`, `holdingPeriod=21`, `costModel=default`, `intrabarConflictPolicy=stop_first`, and an empty `exits` array.
- New universe configurations start with `source=postgres_gold` and a root `and` group seeded with a single blank condition.
- New `stop_loss_fixed` rules are seeded with `value=0.08`, `reference=entry_price`, and `priceField=low`.
- New `take_profit_fixed` rules are seeded with `value=0.15`, `reference=entry_price`, and `priceField=high`.
- New `trailing_stop_pct` rules are seeded with `value=0.07`, `reference=highest_since_entry`, and `priceField=low`.
- New `trailing_stop_atr` rules are seeded with `value=3`, `atrColumn=atr_14d`, `reference=highest_since_entry`, and `priceField=low`.
- New `time_stop` rules are seeded with `value=40` and `priceField=close`.
