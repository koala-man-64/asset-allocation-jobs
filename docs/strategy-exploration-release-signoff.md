## Agent Signoff Matrix

| Agent | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| delivery-orchestrator-agent | PASS | Work items completed with evidence-mapped closure. |
| application-project-analyst-technical-explainer | PASS | End-to-end lineage documented from gold jobs -> lookup store -> API -> UI export flow. |
| db-steward | PASS | Table constraints, PK/indexes, sync semantics, and non-destructive upsert behavior implemented. |
| delivery-engineer-agent | PASS | Migration, script, API, UI, tests, and docs delivered. |
| frontend-design | PASS | Strategy Exploration page remains aligned with existing app visual language and UX flow. |
| architecture-review-agent | PASS | Read-only API surface, bounded filters/pagination, and deterministic metadata source-of-truth. |
| cloud-security-vulnerability-expert | PASS | Parameterized SQL, constrained table/status filters, no write endpoint exposure in this release. |
| ui-testing-expert | PASS | UI behavior covered for table/column browsing, selection, dedupe, and export list lifecycle. |
| software-testing-validation-architect | PASS | Layered tests added across migration, API, sync behavior, seed drift gate, and UI interaction. |
| qa-release-gate-agent | PASS | Acceptance scenarios mapped to automated checks and feature-level regression tests. |
| maintainability-steward | PASS | Shared catalog constants + seed + script centralize metadata ownership and reduce drift. |
| code-hygiene-agent | PASS | Type-safe API/UI models and structured helper functions added without broad churn. |
| cleanup-change-debris-auditor | PASS | No debug residue or temporary feature scaffolding retained. |
| code-drift-sentinel | PASS | Drift guard test added for expected gold-column coverage and placeholder policy. |
| project-workflow-auditor-agent | PASS | Changes align to migration/test/doc patterns and avoid unsafe workflow mutations. |
| technical-writer-dev-advocate | PASS | Operator runbook and sync commands documented with paths and usage. |
| forensic-debugger | PASS (Not Invoked) | No blocking defect encountered during implementation slice. |

## Gate Evidence

- Migration and constraint gate: `tests/test_postgres_migrations.py`
- Seed drift gate: `tests/tools/test_gold_column_lookup_seed.py`
- Sync behavior gate: `tests/tools/test_sync_gold_column_lookup_script.py`
- API contract gate: `tests/api/test_postgres_endpoints.py`
- UI flow gate: `ui/src/app/__tests__/StrategyDataCatalogPage.test.tsx`

## Open Risks

1. Seed descriptions are broad for some high-cardinality feature columns and may need deeper domain curation over time.
2. The sync script assumes `gold.column_lookup` already exists (migration required before first run).

## Release Recommendation

**Go** for read/export Strategy Exploration release with DB+script metadata authoring model.
